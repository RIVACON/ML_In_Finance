# Machine Learning in Finance

This is a collection of jupyter notebooks containing basic use cases of Machine Learning methods in the financial sector.

It is intended as a first introduction and reference for basic use cases of ML in the area of quantitative finance. The notebooks use only standard ML and Data Science toolkits, most notably sklearn and tensorflow.
Every notebook is (almost) independent from the others and ready to use. Therefore you can select only the notebook you are interested in!

## Is this series of notebooks complete?

No, but we will upload more notebooks from time to time.

Note that these notebooks are not intended to be a complete tutorial and we will not explain the basic knowledge in statistics, financial mathematics and python programming.
However, every time we will introduce a concept, we will also add a link to a reference. 

## How to easily use the notebooks?

By clicking on the **binder** badge at the top, you can start a safari through the notebooks.
