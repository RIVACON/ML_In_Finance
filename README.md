# Machine Learning in Finance

This is a collection of jupyter notebooks containing basic use cases of Machine Learning methods in the financial sector.


## Is this a tutorial?

No, but almost.

It is intended as a first introduction and reference for certain use cases of ML in the area of quantitative finance. The notebooks use only standard ML and Data Science toolkits, most notably sklearn and tensorflow.
Every notebook is (almost) independent from the others and ready to use. Therefore you can select only the notebook you are interested in!

## Who are these notebooks for?

Not for absolute beginners.

In these notebooks we will not explain the basic knowledge in statistics, financial mathematics and python programming.
However, every time we will introduce a concept, we will also add a link to a reference. 


## Is this series of notebooks complete?

No, but we will upload more notebooks from time to time.
